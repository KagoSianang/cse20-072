    <h1 style="color:black" align="center">THE HISTORY</h1>
	<p style="background-color:white">The history of the city of Tokyo stretches back some 400 years. Originally named Edo, the city started to flourish after Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa Shogunate here in 1603. As the center of politics and culture in Japan, Edo grew into a huge city with a population of over a million by the mid-eighteenth century.
	Throughout this time, the Emperor resided in Kyoto, which was the formal capital of the nation.
	The Edo Period lasted for nearly 260 years until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when the Tokugawa Shogunate ended and imperial rule was restored. 
	The Emperor moved to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. Thus, Tokyo became the capital of Japan.</p>

	<p style="background-color:white">During the Meiji era (1868-1912), Japan began its avid assimilation of Western civilization.
	Buildings made of stone and bricks were built on the sites of the mansions of feudal lords, and the major roads were paved with round stones.
	In 1869 Japan’s first telecommunications line was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama, and the first steam locomotive started running in 1872 from Shimbashi to Yokohama.
	Western hairstyles replaced the traditional topknot worn by men, and bowler hats, high collars, and bustled skirts were the height of fashion. 
	In 1882 Japan’s first zoological gardens were opened in Ueno. In 1885 the cabinet system of government was adopted and Ito Hirobumi became Japan’s first prime minister.
	With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan in 1889 Japan established the political system of a modern state.</p>
	<p style="background-color:white" >As part of this HISTORY, Tokyo was formerly known as Edo in the 20th century. The name was changed to Tokyo in 1890 in light of the Meiji Restoration</p>

	<h1 style="color:gold" align="center">ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY</h1>
	<p style="background-color:silver" >Japan has had a reputation of being at the forefront of technological development for quite some time. Whether that be with the tech industry, entertainment, or in medical research, the Japanese are always looking to innovate. 
	With the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Games on the horizon, Japan will be looking to make a unique experience utilizing technology. The upcoming Summer Olympics and Paralympics have been called a balancing act between traditional culture and modernity.
	The Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee and the Japanese government is constantly looking into what kind of technology should be featured at the games. From A.I driven vehicles and 3D meteor showers, to algae based biofuel, there are quite a few
	fascinating developments that may make an appearance. Here are six different areas of technological innovation that will hopefully be on display for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
<image src="C:\Users\CSE20-072\Desktop\HTML\technology1.jpg" height="145" width="300" align="left">
<p style="background-color: silver"> Japanese are obsessed with the newest thing and the latest technology. Air conditioners are controlled by remotes; televisions speak in English and Japanese; cars tell you where to go; 
and robots are everywhere. In automated Japan, taxi doors open and close 
automatically, airports are cleaned by vacuum cleaners that operate without human help and parking 
lots have talking ticket-taking machines. Japanese scientists are currently trying to develop cars that can drive themselves.</p>
<p style="background-color:#a9def2">The push for robotics and the use of A.I during the Tokyo Games has steadily increased over the past couple years. However the expectations of 100% fully operational robots is a stretch. They do have however a variety of robotics that do offer assistance in specific areas. 
Here are just some of the examples.</p>
<p style="background-color: #a9def2">Two different robots have been confirmed to be making an appearance to help guide and translate for tourists. Softbank has been developing their robot named “Pepper” for the past four years and has been for sale as of late. The other robot Hitachi’s “EMIEW3” will also provide some services at the games. These robots will serve a similar role, but seem to have slight differences. They both will predominantly be in airports, stations, shops and tourist locations. The differences seems that Pepper is more communication oriented for translating information, featuring an I-Pad that is capable of displaying messages via text and able to be utilized by guests to aid their experience. EMIEW3 is more geared towards physically guiding people to locations, featuring quick and agile movements. The cute designs are to not scare away young visitors.</p>

<h1 style="color:blue" align="center">THE CULTURE</h1>
<p style="background-color: gold">Tokyo is known for its historic shrines and temples, and performing arts such as Noh, Kabuki and Rakugo,
 which have been enjoyed for centuries. Its major venues which celebrate Japanese cultural traditions include the Kabukiza Theatre,
 the National Noh Theatre and the Kokugikan Hall.</p>

 <p style="background-color:gold">The area now known as Tokyo began around the city of Edo, which established itself as a centre of commerce,
 art and high culture in Japan during the 17th and 18th centuries, known as the Edo period. It was renamed Tokyo
 and became the capital of Japan in 1869, after the Emperor Meiji moved from the former capital Kyoto, 
 restoring imperial rule to Japan. During the late 19th century Japan underwent rapid modernisation and 
 cultural change, including the building of roads, railways and telecommunications lines, the popularity of 
 Western hairstyles and fashions replacing traditional topknots and kimonos, and the move to a cabinet system 
 of government. The city was heavily damaged by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, and later during World War Two.
 Cycles of economic boom and bust took place throughout the late 20th century, matched by the rise of consumerism and
 cycles of rapid population decline and growth in the city. Tokyo now has a population of 13 million people 
 in its centre and over 38 million including its metropolitan area,
 making it the largest city in the world.</p>
<p style="background-color: gold">The city today is one where innovation meets tradition. Tokyo is known for its historic shrines and temples, 
and performing arts such as Noh, Kabuki and Rakugo, which have been enjoyed for centuries. Its major venues 
which celebrate Japanese cultural traditions include the Kabukiza Theatre, the National Noh Theatre 
and the Kokugikan Hall. Meanwhile Tokyo is renowned for new trends in fashion, music, art, technology and animation, 
and as a cultural centre for creators in Japan and beyond. Social media tools originating in Tokyo, such as LINE, 
have spread throughout Japan and the world. Niconico, Japan’s largest video social website has over 50 million 
registered members. The Niconico Chokaigi festival, which allows members to connect in person, has been attended by over 15
 million people. As well as being an international cultural hub, Tokyo’s identity encompasses many local identities
 including neighbourhoods such as Asakusa, Akihabara, Harajuku and Shibuya which have distinctive cultural characteristics.</p>
 <p style="background-color:white">Part of Tokyo’s culture was its growth in Animation, or better known as Anime</p>
 <h2 align="center>ANIME CULTURE</h2>
 <p style="background-color: orange">In Japanese culture, anime is actually a term for any mass-produced animation, Japanese or non-Japanese.
 And, importantly, in Japan, anime is not just a culture for kids. Rather, anime series like Neon Genesis Evangelion,
 Attack on Titan, Death Note, Naruto, DragonBall Z and Cowboy Bebop were all hugely successful amongst adults too</p>
