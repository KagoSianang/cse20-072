<h2 align="center">OTHER UPCOMING EVENTS IN THE 2021 YEAR</h2>
<h2>MAY</h2>
<p>Kanda-matsuri Festival, a grand six-day celebration, is considered one of Japan’s three greatest festivals. This religious festival is centered on Kanda Myojin Shrine, and it features huge processions of mikoshi (portable shrines) and floats. Massive crowds turn out to celebrate this epic event.
If you’re a night owl, the Kurayami Matsuri (Darkness Festival) in Fuchu involves portable shrines being carried through the night of May 5. If you’re up for braving the darkness of the wee hours, this is an awesome experience</p>

<h2>JUNE</h2>
<p>The biggest traditional festival on June’s calendar is the historic Sanno Masturi in Asakusa, considered to be one of Japan’s three great festivals. The festivities last 11 days, and every day offers something new!
As summer kicks off, you could head to the Hachioji region of Tokyo for the Fussa Hotaru (Firefly) Festival to witness fireflies dancing in the twilight sky along the banks of the Kita-Asakawa River.
If you’re interested in flower festivals, check out the Katsushika Shobu Matsuri (Iris Festival) or the Bunkyo Ajisai Matsuri (Hydrangea Festival).</p>

<h2>JUNE</h2>
<p>Japan has some amazing fireworks festivals, and the king of them all is the Sumidagawa River Fireworks Festival in Ryogoku. It’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the world’s coolest firework experiences. Thousands upon thousands of fireworks of all colors, shapes and styles, launched from multiple spots around the neighborhood, fill the skies for close to two hours. Get there early to claim a good spot!

Tokyo has lots of other great fireworks festivals in July and August, so if you’re visiting during that time of year, check and see what’s on.

If you’re in Kyoto, don’t miss the Gion Matsuri. It is the most famous Kyoto festival, and perhaps the most famous festival in all of Japan. It officially runs all July, but the main events are the Yamahoko Junko, two processions of extremely lavish wooden floats.</p>
