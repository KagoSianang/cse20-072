	  <p style="background-color:#ffe4e1" align="center">Why Tokyo?: The Fashion Capital Where Rules Are Being Rewritten. 
	  Tokyo is considered as the Asian style capital, known for its vibrant youth fashion culture 
	  and trending street style, 
	  influencing the global fashion world.Tokyo is a metropolis like no other in the world.
	  From impressive architecture and heritage culture to crazy street fashion, and Japanese fashion brands that are known all over the world, Tokyo is a city that combines the past, the present and the future all in one place.
Today, Japan is the second-largest luxury market in the world, behind the US, but ahead of China. 
The younger generations are at the forefront of this trend, purchasing European high-end luxury brands like Balenciaga, Céline, and Gucci. This resulted in a total expenditure of $97 billion on footwear and clothing in 2017, pushing the Japanese annual luxury market growth rate to 7.6%.
With over 431,000 employees in clothing and textile manufacturing, the 
Japanese fashion industry has brought out some acclaimed brands that have made 
themselves a name all over the globe. Think of Rei Kawakubo who is the creative head behind 
Japanese fashion label Comme des Garçons, or famous streetwear brand BAPE. If you’re into these 
Japanese fashion brands based in Tokyo, then Ginza is the neighborhood to go to! Located southeast 
of Tokyo, Ginza is home to many luxury flagship stores and retailers such as Dover Street Market, 
luxury department store Mitsukoshi, or high-end boutique United Arrows.</p>

<image src="Fashion4.jpg" height="400" width="250" align="left">
<p style="background-color:#ffe4e1" align="center">TOKYO Streetwear was created to meet a still unsatisfied demand from people looking for real Japanese style clothes until it was only supplied by the "Print on demand" 
sites offering low-quality design and clothing except some like artisthoodie.com</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffe4e1">Japan has annual Fashion Runway which has attracted many tourists and its often hosted in the beautiful City Of TOKYO </p>

<h1 style="color:white" align="center">THE FOOD</h1>
<p style="background-color:white" align="center">HERE ARE THE TOP 5 BEST CUISINES TO TRY IN TOKYO </p>

<image src="food1.jpg" height="400" width="800">
<h2  align="left">5.Tendon</h2>
<p style="background-color:white">The clue is in the name, a portmanteau of ‘tempura’ and ‘donburi’. Tendon is therefore a bowl of white rice topped with deep-fried seafood and vegetables. Today, tempura has evolved into a cuisine in its own right, with some specialist restaurants charging tens of thousands of yen for an elaborate set menu, yet tendon remains a humble, affordable dish loved by the masses. Made with fresh seafood that's fried in sesame oil (usually) until golden and crispy, tendon is a go-to fast-food when you need something filling and satisfying.</p>
<image src="food 2.jpg" height="400" width="800">
<h2 align="left">4.Chanko Nabe</h2>
<p style="background-color:white">This protein-rich stew is eaten in large quantities by sumo wrestlers during their weight-gaining phase. The soup is usually made from dashi or chicken stock, and the hotpot predominantly features chicken. That’s because chicken is associated with victory: in a tournament a wrestler should, like the bird, always be on two feet (he loses if any part of his body besides his soles touches the ground). However, you’ll also find chanko nabe made with pork to make the soup more flavourful. </p>
<image src="food 3.jpg" height="400" width="800">
<h2 align="left">3.Sushi</h2>
<p style="background-color:white">Ask a person outside of Japan what comes to mind when they think of Japanese food and they’ll probably say sushi. In fact, sushi as it’s known today is referred to as Edomae sushi, or ‘Edo-style sushi’. Originating in the 1820s, it was commonly served as a quick snack for Edoites at street stalls across Tokyo, with rice vinegar acting as a preserving agent for the fish and rice. It was Japan’s street food. These days you can indulge in classy (and eye-wateringly expensive) omakase courses at top-of-the-line sushi establishments, eat it as fresh as it gets at the fish market, or go cheap and cheerful at conveyor belt (kaitenzushi) or standing sushi restaurants.</p>
<image src="food 4.jpg" height="400" width="800">
<h2 align="left">2.Ramen</h2>
<p style="background-color:white">Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions. </p>
 <image src="food 5.jpg" height="400" width="800">
<h2 align="left">1.Anago</h2>
<p style="background-color:white">Anago (saltwater conger eel) is the less-fatty, seafaring brother of the more well-known unagi, or freshwater eel. It’s also significantly less rare, with unagi hovering on the endangered species list for years, making anago a more regular menu item. As the fish is native to Tokyo Bay, it has made its way into local cuisine in various guises, enjoyed for its clean, delicate taste. Both anago tempura and simmered anago as a sushi topping are considered Tokyo specialities, but anago is also commonly served in preparations similar to unagi: either with a sweet-savoury kabayaki sauce, or in a plainly grilled style known as shirayaki.</p>
 <h2 align="center">BUT WHY WOULD YOU VISIT TOKYO?/Shikashi, naze anata wa Tōkyō o otozureru nodesu ka?</h2>
 <p align="center">Tokyo, the capital city of Japan and one of the best places to visit in Asia, is also home to the Imperial Palace and the seat of Government and Parliament. Located in East-Central Honshu, the largest of Japan's main islands, this heavily populated city is well worth visiting, and serves as a great base from which to explore other parts of the country.
One of the world's most modern cities in terms of its infrastructure and design - due largely to the 1923 earthquake and the devastation of WWII - Tokyo also holds the title of the world's most expensive city in which to live. Fortunately, it's also one of the easiest to get around thanks to its superb rail and subway networks.
The cultural side of Tokyo is famous for its numerous things to do and top attractions, including museums; festivals; internationally noted cuisine; and professional sports clubs, including baseball, football, and traditional Japanese pursuits like sumo wrestling. It's also a city rich in music and theater, with numerous venues featuring everything from Japanese to modern dramas, symphony orchestras, and pop and rock concerts.
Explore the city and begin with our list of the top things to do in Tokyo.</p>
<p><Best Places for Tourist to visit when they come to Tokyo/p>
<h3 align="left">1.The Imperial Palace</h3>
<image src="Tour1.jpg" height="450" width="600" align="left">
 <p>In the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the exquisite Sensō-ji Temple (Kinryū-zan Sensō-ji)) - the city's most famous shrine - stands at the end of a long street market hosting vendors selling masks, carvings, combs made of ebony and wood, toys, kimonos, fabrics, and precious paper goods.</p>
 <p>Dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of compassion, the temple was established in AD 645 and retains its original appearance despite having been rebuilt numerous times. </p>
 <p>Highlights of a visit include seeing the Kaminari-mon Gate with its 3.3-meter-high red paper lantern bearing the inscription "Thunder Gate," as well as the famous and much-loved Incense Vat, reputed to drive away ailments (you'll see people cupping their hands around the smoke and applying it to the part of their body needing healing).</p>
 <p>Also of note are the fascinating temple doves, said to be Kannon's sacred messengers. Be sure to drop a coin in the Omikuji boxes near the entrance, from which you can retrieve a piece of paper that will tell your fortune.</p>
 <pAfterwards, be sure to explore the rest of the 50-acre temple precinct with its warren of lanes. If you can, revisit the temple again at night for a completely different (and far less crowded) illuminated experience.></p>
 <h3 align="left">2.The Miraikan and Edo-Tokyo Museums</h3>
 <image src="Tour2.jpg" height="300" width="600" align="left">

  <h3 align="left">3.Stop in at the National Museum of Nature and Science</h3>
 <image src="Tour3.jpg" height="300" width="600" align="left">
 <p>Located in Tokyo's Ueno Park, the superb National Museum of Nature and Science (Kokuritsu Kagaku Hakubutsukan) opened in 1871 and is one of the country's oldest museums.</p>
 <p>Now completely renovated and modernized, the museum also boasts a reputation as one of the country's busiest and largest museums, housing a vast collection of some 250,000 materials related to natural history and science.</p>
 <p>These include many fascinating interactive displays on space development, nuclear energy, and transportation, each allowing visitors a unique insight into the latest scientific and technological advances. Highlights of the Japan Gallery (Nihonkan) include numerous exhibits of prehistoric creatures and the history of the Japanese people, including traditional customs and outfits. In the Global Gallery (Chikyūkan) you'll see many excellent scientific and technology displays, including robotics and vintage vehicles.</p>
 <h3 align="left">4.Wander through the Tokyo National Museum.</h3>
 <image src="Tour4.jpg" height="300" width="600" align="left">
 <p>Tokyo National Museum (ōkyō Kokuritsu Hakubutsukan) houses more than 100,000 important works of Japanese, Chinese, and Indian art, including more than 100 national treasures.</p>
 <p>Opened in 1938, the TNM, as it's usually known, includes highlights such as numerous Buddhist sculptures from Japan and China dating from the 6th century to the present, as well as fine collections of old textiles, historical weapons, and military equipment.</p>

Important artwork includes Japanese paintings from the 7th to the 14th centuries, and another must-see are the museum's exquisite collections of Japanese and Chinese masterpieces of lacquerwork of various centuries, including examples of lacquer-carving, gold lacquer, and lacquer with mother of pearl. There are also many fine examples of calligraphy.</p>

 <h3 align="left">5.Enjoy Nature and Art at the Meiji Shrine</h3>
 <image src="Tour5.jpg" height="300" width="600" align="left">
 <p>Dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken, construction of the splendid Meiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū) began in 1915 and was completed in 1926. Although the original structure was destroyed during WWII, it was rebuilt in 1958 and remains one of Tokyo's most important religious sites.</p>
 <p>Surrounded by a 175-acre evergreen forest that is home to some 120,000 trees representing species found across Japan - as well as the interesting 'wishing tree', on which visitors can write and hang their deepest wishes - the shrine's highlights include its Inner Precinct (Naien) with its museum containing royal treasures, and the Outer Precinct (Gaien).</p>
 <p>It's in the Outer Precinct that you'll find the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery with its superb collection of murals relating to the lives of the emperor and empress.
